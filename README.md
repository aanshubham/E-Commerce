# E-Commerce

# Introduction

The Django E-Commerce Website is a simple e-commerce platform built using the Django web framework. It allows users to browse and purchase products online, and provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing products, orders, and customers. The website includes features such as user authentication and authorization, shopping cart functionality, and order tracking. It also includes email notifications for order confirmation and status updates. The website is designed to be easily customizable and extensible, allowing developers to add new features and functionality as needed. Whether you are a small business owner looking to sell your products online, or a developer looking to build an e-commerce platform for a client, the Django E-Commerce Website is a great choice.


# Requirements

To run the Django E-Commerce Website locally, you will need the following software and tools:

Python 3.8 or higher: The Django web framework is written in Python, so you will need to have Python installed on your local machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Django 3.2 or higher: The Django E-Commerce Website is built using the Django web framework, so you will need to have Django installed on your local machine. You can install Django using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command: pip install Django
A database server: The Django E-Commerce Website uses a relational database to store data such as product information, customer details, and order history. You can use any database server supported by Django, such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. For testing and development purposes, SQLite is a good choice as it requires no configuration and is included with Python by default.
Git or another version control system: It is recommended that you use a version control system to manage your code and collaborate with others. Git is a popular version control system that integrates well with the Django E-Commerce Website project. You can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Make sure you have all of these software and tools installed and configured correctly before proceeding with the installation instructions.

# Installation

To install the Django E-Commerce Website on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub or another version control system. You can use the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-ecommerce.git

2. Change into the project directory:
- cd django-ecommerce

3. Create a virtual environment for the project and activate it. You can use the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module:
- python3 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux/MacOS
- venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # on Windows

4. Install the required dependencies using pip. You can use the following command to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Configure the database settings in the settings.py file. By default, the Django E-Commerce Website uses SQLite as the database backend. If you want to use a different database server, you will need to modify the DATABASES setting in the settings.py file accordingly.

6. Apply the database migrations to create the necessary tables and relationships in the database. You can use the following command to run the migrations:
- python manage.py migrate

7. Create a superuser account for the Django admin interface. You can use the following command to create a new superuser account:
- python manage.py createsuperuser

8. Run the Django development server using the manage.py script. You can use the following command to start the development server:
- python manage.py runserver
Once the development server is running, you can access the Django E-Commerce Website by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser. You can log in to the Django admin interface by navigating to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and entering the credentials for the superuser account you created in step 7.
